### Summary

Information Visualization application designed with D3 framework to help the user identify patterns and trends in a dataset about popular movie titles. The application gives the user the ability to add or remove attributes to the X or Y axis based on which comparisons they want to see, as well as modify the weight of each variable on each axis. It also provides the ability to highlight filter based on movie genre and select an individual movie data point to analyze how it changes as you adjust the parameters.
